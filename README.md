# Rosalie Newman's Portfolio

[Live Site](https://rosalie0.github.io/)

## What is this?

This project is my portfolio website.
It contains:

- information about me
- links to various projects I have worked
- other relevant experiences and details.

## What I learned

I got to practice more of my front-end and CSS skills. Specifically:

### Tailwind

While I enjoyed how easy it was to apply styles, especially the built in colors, having each style as a class name made playing with CSS in the chrome dev tools more cumbersome. The best past of tailwind is the ease of applying specific styles cased on dark more or based on media queries.

### Perfomance, Image Compression and Chunking

Using the chrome devtool's Network tab, I was able to discover unneccesary network requests I made and reduce data. I learnt more about load times, and why so much of the web uses .webp over .jpeg and (heavens forbid!) uncompressed pngs.

### Accessbility

When I started the site I made a color palette that looked good to me - but soon discovered it had poor contrast rating. I adjusted based on this, as well as for colorblindness using the Lighthouse chrome devtools.

Other pieces of the puzzle I learnt about was the need to label certain non-text elements for screen-reader usage, such as the dark/light mode button, and the differences between `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`.

## Getting Started

To view this portfolio, you can either visit the deploy link, or host it locally on your own machine.
Steps to explain how to do this is yet to come!

## Planned features

To begin with I will be creating some bare bones of a few components using just **React** and **CSS**. However, in the near future I am planning to implement **three JS** and **React Framer Motion** into the project, to give it some _life_.
