# Rosalie Newman's Portfolio

[Live Site](https://rosalie0.github.io/)

## What is this?

This project is my portfolio website.
It contains:

- information about me
- links to various projects I have worked
- other relevant experiences and details.

## Planned features

To begin with I will be creating some bare bones of a few components using just **React** and **CSS**. However, in the near future I am planning to implement **three JS** and **React Framer Motion** into the project, to give it some _life_.
